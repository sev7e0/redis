This README is just a fast *quick start* document. You can find more detailed documentation at [redis.io](https://redis.io).

What is Redis?
--------------

Redis通常被称为*数据结构*服务器. 这意味着Redis通过一组命令提供对可变数据结构的访问，
这些命令使用带有TCP套接字和简单协议的* server-client *模型发送。因此，不同的进程
可以以共享方式查询和修改相同的数据结构。

Redis中实现的数据结构有一些特殊属性：

* Redis关心将它们存储在磁盘上，即使它们总是被提供并修改到服务器内存中。这意味着Redis速度很快，但这也是非易失性的。
* 数据结构的实现强调内存效率，因此与使用高级编程语言建模的相同数据结构相比，Redis内部的数据结构可能会使用更少的内存。
* Redis提供了许多在数据库中很容易找到的功能，如复制，可调节的持久性，群集，高可用。

另一个很好的例子是将Redis视为memcached的更复杂版本，其中操作不仅仅是SET和GET，而是用于处理复杂数据类型（如Lists，Sets，有序数据结构等）的操作。

Building Redis
--------------

Redis can be compiled and used on Linux, OSX, OpenBSD, NetBSD, FreeBSD.
We support big endian and little endian architectures, and both 32 bit
and 64 bit systems.

redis支持多种平台和架构，Linux, OSX, OpenBSD, NetBSD, FreeBSD。同时支持 big endian
和little endian架构，还包括32位和64位操作系统。

It may compile on Solaris derived systems (for instance SmartOS) but our support for this platform is *best effort* and Redis is not guaranteed to work as well as in Linux, OSX, and \*BSD there.

同时他可以在一些其他的衍生版本中进行编译例如Solaris的SmartOS，但对这些平台只能是尽力而为
无法保证。


编译命令:

    % make

可以使用运行32位Redis二进制文件:

    % make 32bit

编译后可以进行测试:

    % make test

Fixing build problems with dependencies or cached build options
---------

在`deps`文件夹中包含了一些redis的依赖，若依赖文件发生变化，在`make` 使用时并不会自动的重新构建。



当你使用了`git pull`重新拉取代码或者其他方式修改了依赖文件时，请使用一下命令进行清理和
重新构建。

    make distclean

这将会清理: jemalloc, lua, hiredis, linenoise.

Also if you force certain build options like 32bit target, no C compiler
optimizations (for debugging purposes), and other similar build time options,
those options are cached indefinitely until you issue a `make distclean`
command.

Fixing problems building 32 bit binaries
---------

If after building Redis with a 32 bit target you need to rebuild it
with a 64 bit target, or the other way around, you need to perform a
`make distclean` in the root directory of the Redis distribution.

In case of build errors when trying to build a 32 bit binary of Redis, try
the following steps:

* Install the packages libc6-dev-i386 (also try g++-multilib).
* Try using the following command line instead of `make 32bit`:
  `make CFLAGS="-m32 -march=native" LDFLAGS="-m32"`

Allocator
---------

Selecting a non-default memory allocator when building Redis is done by setting
the `MALLOC` environment variable. Redis is compiled and linked against libc
malloc by default, with the exception of jemalloc being the default on Linux
systems. This default was picked because jemalloc has proven to have fewer
fragmentation problems than libc malloc.

To force compiling against libc malloc, use:

    % make MALLOC=libc

To compile against jemalloc on Mac OS X systems, use:

    % make MALLOC=jemalloc

Verbose build
-------------

Redis will build with a user friendly colorized output by default.
If you want to see a more verbose output use the following:

    % make V=1

Running Redis
-------------

使用默认配置启动redis:

    % cd src
    % ./redis-server

指定配置文件的方式启动redis:

    % cd src
    % ./redis-server /path/to/redis.conf

可以在启动时传递参数，进行相关的redis配置:

    % ./redis-server --port 9999 --replicaof 127.0.0.1 6379
    % ./redis-server /etc/redis/6379.conf --loglevel debug

在redis.conf中所有的配置都支持使用该方式进行配置。

Playing with Redis
------------------

在启动redis后可以启动一个新的terminal执行redis-cli，执行以下操作:

    % cd src
    % ./redis-cli
    redis> ping
    PONG
    redis> set foo bar
    OK
    redis> get foo
    "bar"
    redis> incr mycounter
    (integer) 1
    redis> incr mycounter
    (integer) 2
    redis>

使用更多的命令，请参考 http://redis.io/commands.

Installing Redis
-----------------

In order to install Redis binaries into /usr/local/bin just use:

    % make install

You can use `make PREFIX=/some/other/directory install` if you wish to use a
different destination.

Make install will just install binaries in your system, but will not configure
init scripts and configuration files in the appropriate place. This is not
needed if you want just to play a bit with Redis, but if you are installing
it the proper way for a production system, we have a script doing this
for Ubuntu and Debian systems:

    % cd utils
    % ./install_server.sh

The script will ask you a few questions and will setup everything you need
to run Redis properly as a background daemon that will start again on
system reboots.

You'll be able to stop and start Redis using the script named
`/etc/init.d/redis_<portnumber>`, for instance `/etc/init.d/redis_6379`.

Redis internals
===

If you are reading this README you are likely in front of a Github page
or you just untarred the Redis distribution tar ball. In both the cases
you are basically one step away from the source code, so here we explain
the Redis source code layout, what is in each file as a general idea, the
most important functions and structures inside the Redis server and so forth.
We keep all the discussion at a high level without digging into the details
since this document would be huge otherwise and our code base changes
continuously, but a general idea should be a good starting point to
understand more. Moreover most of the code is heavily commented and easy
to follow.

若果你正在github上阅读这个自述文件，或者你打开了redis.tar，那么你距离redis源码只有
一步之遥，所以在这将会介绍以下redis的源码布局，包括每一个文件中的内容是什么，和redis
内部一些重要的功能和数据结构。在这里只会讨论一些最高层面的东西，不会深入到细节中讨论，
因为这个文件很大，否则代码库就会改变不断，但一般的想法应该是从一个简单的起点了解更
多。此外，大多数代码都有很多注释。

Source code layout
---

Redis根目录只包含这个README，即Makefile调用`src`目录中的实际Makefile和一个例子
Redis和Sentinel的配置。你可以找到一些shell用于执行Redis，Redis群集和Redis Sentinel
单元测试，在`tests`中实现目录。

在根目录中将会看到以下文件夹:

* `src`: 包含了redis的具体实现，使用C语言编写。
* `tests`: 包含了一些测试单元, 使用 Tcl 实现.
* `deps`: 包含Redis使用的库. 编译Redis所需的一切都在这个目录中;你的系统只需要提供`
    libc`，POSIX兼容接口和C编译器。值得注意的是，“deps”包含了一个`jemalloc`的副本，
    它是Linux下Redis的默认分配器。请注意，在`deps`下也有从Redis项目开始的东西，但主
    存储库不是`antirez / redis`。这个规则的一个例外是`deps / geohash-int`，它是
    Redis使用的低级地理编码库：它源自一个不同的项目，但此时它分歧太多，以至于它被直接
    开发为一个独立的实体。 Redis存储库。

There are a few more directories but they are not very important for our goals
here. We'll focus mostly on `src`, where the Redis implementation is contained,
exploring what there is inside each file. The order in which files are
exposed is the logical one to follow in order to disclose different layers
of complexity incrementally.

Note: lately Redis was refactored quite a bit. Function names and file
names have been changed, so you may find that this documentation reflects the
`unstable` branch more closely. For instance in Redis 3.0 the `server.c`
and `server.h` files were named `redis.c` and `redis.h`. However the overall
structure is the same. Keep in mind that all the new developments and pull
requests should be performed against the `unstable` branch.

server.h
---

The simplest way to understand how a program works is to understand the
data structures it uses. So we'll start from the main header file of
Redis, which is `server.h`.

All the server configuration and in general all the shared state is
defined in a global structure called `server`, of type `struct redisServer`.
A few important fields in this structure are:

* `server.db` is an array of Redis databases, where data is stored.
* `server.commands` is the command table.
* `server.clients` is a linked list of clients connected to the server.
* `server.master` is a special client, the master, if the instance is a replica.

There are tons of other fields. Most fields are commented directly inside
the structure definition.

Another important Redis data structure is the one defining a client.
In the past it was called `redisClient`, now just `client`. The structure
has many fields, here we'll just show the main ones:

    struct client {
        int fd;
        sds querybuf;
        int argc;
        robj **argv;
        redisDb *db;
        int flags;
        list *reply;
        char buf[PROTO_REPLY_CHUNK_BYTES];
        ... many other fields ...
    }

The client structure defines a *connected client*:

* The `fd` field is the client socket file descriptor.
* `argc` and `argv` are populated with the command the client is executing, so that functions implementing a given Redis command can read the arguments.
* `querybuf` accumulates the requests from the client, which are parsed by the Redis server according to the Redis protocol and executed by calling the implementations of the commands the client is executing.
* `reply` and `buf` are dynamic and static buffers that accumulate the replies the server sends to the client. These buffers are incrementally written to the socket as soon as the file descriptor is writable.

As you can see in the client structure above, arguments in a command
are described as `robj` structures. The following is the full `robj`
structure, which defines a *Redis object*:

    typedef struct redisObject {
        unsigned type:4;
        unsigned encoding:4;
        unsigned lru:LRU_BITS; /* lru time (relative to server.lruclock) */
        int refcount;
        void *ptr;
    } robj;

Basically this structure can represent all the basic Redis data types like
strings, lists, sets, sorted sets and so forth. The interesting thing is that
it has a `type` field, so that it is possible to know what type a given
object has, and a `refcount`, so that the same object can be referenced
in multiple places without allocating it multiple times. Finally the `ptr`
field points to the actual representation of the object, which might vary
even for the same type, depending on the `encoding` used.

Redis objects are used extensively in the Redis internals, however in order
to avoid the overhead of indirect accesses, recently in many places
we just use plain dynamic strings not wrapped inside a Redis object.

server.c
---

This is the entry point of the Redis server, where the `main()` function
is defined. The following are the most important steps in order to startup
the Redis server.

* `initServerConfig()` setups the default values of the `server` structure.
* `initServer()` allocates the data structures needed to operate, setup the listening socket, and so forth.
* `aeMain()` starts the event loop which listens for new connections.

There are two special functions called periodically by the event loop:

1. `serverCron()` is called periodically (according to `server.hz` frequency), and performs tasks that must be performed from time to time, like checking for timedout clients.
2. `beforeSleep()` is called every time the event loop fired, Redis served a few requests, and is returning back into the event loop.

Inside server.c you can find code that handles other vital things of the Redis server:

* `call()` is used in order to call a given command in the context of a given client.
* `activeExpireCycle()` handles eviciton of keys with a time to live set via the `EXPIRE` command.
* `freeMemoryIfNeeded()` is called when a new write command should be performed but Redis is out of memory according to the `maxmemory` directive.
* The global variable `redisCommandTable` defines all the Redis commands, specifying the name of the command, the function implementing the command, the number of arguments required, and other properties of each command.

networking.c
---

This file defines all the I/O functions with clients, masters and replicas
(which in Redis are just special clients):

* `createClient()` allocates and initializes a new client.
* the `addReply*()` family of functions are used by commands implementations in order to append data to the client structure, that will be transmitted to the client as a reply for a given command executed.
* `writeToClient()` transmits the data pending in the output buffers to the client and is called by the *writable event handler* `sendReplyToClient()`.
* `readQueryFromClient()` is the *readable event handler* and accumulates data from read from the client into the query buffer.
* `processInputBuffer()` is the entry point in order to parse the client query buffer according to the Redis protocol. Once commands are ready to be processed, it calls `processCommand()` which is defined inside `server.c` in order to actually execute the command.
* `freeClient()` deallocates, disconnects and removes a client.

aof.c and rdb.c
---

As you can guess from the names these files implement the RDB and AOF
persistence for Redis. Redis uses a persistence model based on the `fork()`
system call in order to create a thread with the same (shared) memory
content of the main Redis thread. This secondary thread dumps the content
of the memory on disk. This is used by `rdb.c` to create the snapshots
on disk and by `aof.c` in order to perform the AOF rewrite when the
append only file gets too big.

The implementation inside `aof.c` has additional functions in order to
implement an API that allows commands to append new commands into the AOF
file as clients execute them.

The `call()` function defined inside `server.c` is responsible to call
the functions that in turn will write the commands into the AOF.

db.c
---

Certain Redis commands operate on specific data types, others are general.
Examples of generic commands are `DEL` and `EXPIRE`. They operate on keys
and not on their values specifically. All those generic commands are
defined inside `db.c`.

Moreover `db.c` implements an API in order to perform certain operations
on the Redis dataset without directly accessing the internal data structures.

The most important functions inside `db.c` which are used in many commands
implementations are the following:

* `lookupKeyRead()` and `lookupKeyWrite()` are used in order to get a pointer to the value associated to a given key, or `NULL` if the key does not exist.
* `dbAdd()` and its higher level counterpart `setKey()` create a new key in a Redis database.
* `dbDelete()` removes a key and its associated value.
* `emptyDb()` removes an entire single database or all the databases defined.

The rest of the file implements the generic commands exposed to the client.

object.c
---

The `robj` structure defining Redis objects was already described. Inside
`object.c` there are all the functions that operate with Redis objects at
a basic level, like functions to allocate new objects, handle the reference
counting and so forth. Notable functions inside this file:

* `incrRefcount()` and `decrRefCount()` are used in order to increment or decrement an object reference count. When it drops to 0 the object is finally freed.
* `createObject()` allocates a new object. There are also specialized functions to allocate string objects having a specific content, like `createStringObjectFromLongLong()` and similar functions.

This file also implements the `OBJECT` command.

replication.c
---

This is one of the most complex files inside Redis, it is recommended to
approach it only after getting a bit familiar with the rest of the code base.
In this file there is the implementation of both the master and replica role
of Redis.

One of the most important functions inside this file is `replicationFeedSlaves()` that writes commands to the clients representing replica instances connected
to our master, so that the replicas can get the writes performed by the clients:
this way their data set will remain synchronized with the one in the master.

This file also implements both the `SYNC` and `PSYNC` commands that are
used in order to perform the first synchronization between masters and
replicas, or to continue the replication after a disconnection.

Other C files
---

* `t_hash.c`, `t_list.c`, `t_set.c`, `t_string.c` and `t_zset.c` contains the implementation of the Redis data types. They implement both an API to access a given data type, and the client commands implementations for these data types.
* `ae.c` implements the Redis event loop, it's a self contained library which is simple to read and understand.
* `sds.c` is the Redis string library, check http://github.com/antirez/sds for more information.
* `anet.c` is a library to use POSIX networking in a simpler way compared to the raw interface exposed by the kernel.
* `dict.c` is an implementation of a non-blocking hash table which rehashes incrementally.
* `scripting.c` implements Lua scripting. It is completely self contained from the rest of the Redis implementation and is simple enough to understand if you are familar with the Lua API.
* `cluster.c` implements the Redis Cluster. Probably a good read only after being very familiar with the rest of the Redis code base. If you want to read `cluster.c` make sure to read the [Redis Cluster specification][3].

Anatomy of a Redis command
---

All the Redis commands are defined in the following way:

    void foobarCommand(client *c) {
        printf("%s",c->argv[1]->ptr); /* Do something with the argument. */
        addReply(c,shared.ok); /* Reply something to the client. */
    }

The command is then referenced inside `server.c` in the command table:

    {"foobar",foobarCommand,2,"rtF",0,NULL,0,0,0,0,0},

In the above example `2` is the number of arguments the command takes,
while `"rtF"` are the command flags, as documented in the command table
top comment inside `server.c`.

After the command operates in some way, it returns a reply to the client,
usually using `addReply()` or a similar function defined inside `networking.c`.

There are tons of commands implementations inside the Redis source code
that can serve as examples of actual commands implementations. To write
a few toy commands can be a good exercise to familiarize with the code base.

There are also many other files not described here, but it is useless to
cover everything. We want to just help you with the first steps.
Eventually you'll find your way inside the Redis code base :-)

Enjoy!
